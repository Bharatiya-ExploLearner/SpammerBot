This spammer bot uses Python's PyAutoGui module.

```
pip install pyautogui
```
You can spam in two ways-
- Text - Simply input the text after selecting respective option, and focus your cursor on the input field where you want to spam. After giving the inputing, you get a few seconds to change the focus of the cursor. The bot will simply write the text you have given to it consistently at fixed intervals and press Enter to send it.

- File - Simply Copy the file (most probably gif or image) and focus on the input area where you want to spam, the bot will simply paste the file consistently at fixed intervals and then press Enter to send it. (If the file is too big, it may take time to be pasted into the input, which could disturb the process, so try to keep the file size as low as possible)
